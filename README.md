## Overview

Project Origination Date: 2021-10-06

#### Disclaimer

No part of this analysis should be considered Financial Advise. It is to be used for Mathematical
and Computer Programming Demonstration Purposes Only. Conduct Your Own Due Diligence.


### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to aid in creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies
are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system
for this new investment.


### Tasks



### Approach

Use an Unsupervised Machine Learning approach with a clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies.


### Deliverables

1. Preprocess the Data for PCA
2. Reduce Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualize Cryptocurrencies Results
